/**Imagine you are developing an e-commerce application. 
The platform needs to sort lists of products based on 
different criteria, such as price, rating, or name. Each 
product object implements the Comparable interface to 
define the natural ordering. To ensure flexibility and 
reusability, you need a generic method that can sort any 
array of Comparable objects. Create a generic method in 
Java that sorts an array of Comparable objects. This method 
should be versatile enough to sort arrays of different types 
of objects (such as products, customers, or orders) as long 
as they implement the Comparable interface.  */
